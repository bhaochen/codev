/**
 * Inline image rendering for the TUI, as Unicode half-block cells.
 *
 * Each cell carries two vertical pixels: U+2580 (upper half block) paints the
 * top pixel with the foreground color and the bottom pixel with the background
 * color. A cell is roughly twice as tall as it is wide, so two stacked
 * half-pixels are about square — the pixel grid maps 1:1 onto
 * `columns x (rows * 2)` with no aspect correction needed.
 *
 * Why not a native graphics protocol (Kitty / iTerm2 / Sixel)?
 * Ink renders into a cell buffer: `Output.write()` tokenizes SGR into interned
 * styles, writes grapheme clusters into `Screen`, and `log-update` diffs frames
 * cell-by-cell, re-emitting only what changed. A DCS/APC graphics payload
 * cannot survive that round trip — it would have to be written out-of-band at
 * an absolute cursor position, with per-frame placement bookkeeping to stop
 * images stacking on repaint, plus explicit purges on resize and scrollback
 * eviction. Half-blocks are ordinary styled text, so they flow through the
 * existing renderer untouched: nothing to ghost, nothing to purge, no resize
 * special-casing, and `stringWidth` already measures these glyphs as width 1
 * (it resolves East Asian ambiguous width as narrow).
 *
 * Everything here degrades to `null` rather than throwing: callers fall back to
 * whatever they rendered before.
