/**
 * Write-ownership claims between concurrently running subagents.
 *
 * Two subagents editing one file do not corrupt it — Edit, Write and
 * NotebookEdit each carry a staleness guard, so the loser's write is refused
 * rather than applied over the winner's. What they do is waste a whole turn:
 * the loser reads the file, reasons about it, calls its tool, and only then
 * learns it lost — via "File has been modified since read", which does not say
 * who moved it or that another agent is involved at all. Writes issued through
 * Bash carry no staleness guard, so there the loser can clobber outright.
 *
 * So: the first subagent to write a path owns it for as long as that agent
 * runs. A different subagent writing the same path is refused immediately and
 * told which agent holds it.
 *
 * Deliberately a refusal, not a lock. `writeTextContent` is synchronous, and
 * its callers document that a yield between the staleness check and the write
 * lets concurrent edits interleave — so there is nothing safe to await on
 * without reopening exactly the window the staleness check exists to close. A
 * refused agent gets an actionable error on the spot instead of blocking, and
 * there is no queue to deadlock.
 *
 * Scope is deliberately narrow:
 * - Only subagents claim, and only subagents are refused. The main session is
 *   the coordinator; it is never blocked and never claims, so no ordinary
 *   single-agent workflow can change behavior.
 * - A refusal requires a different, still-registered subagent to hold the path.
 *   That makes the two-agent condition structural rather than sampled: with one
 *   subagent running nothing can be refused, because the only claim it can meet
 *   is either its own or one whose owner has already finished.
 * - Reads are untouched. Only the write path consults claims.
 *
 * Nothing here reaches the model: no tool schema, description, or system-prompt
 * text changes. Enforcement lives entirely in the write path, so every provider
 * behaves identically and no prompt cache is affected.
