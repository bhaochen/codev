 * a different thing from a real failure, and the UI renders it differently.
 *
 * Matches the wrapped form toolExecution.ts emits
 * (`<tool_use_error>InputValidationError: …</tool_use_error>`) and the bare
 * form, but only at the start of the message — a tool whose own output merely
 * quotes the phrase is a genuine failure and must keep its normal rendering.
 *
 * Leaf module: the React error row imports this, and routing it through
 * toolErrors.ts would pull zod and the whole messages.ts graph into the render
 * path just to test a string prefix.
