/**
 * Literal search inside a persisted tool output.
 *
 * When a tool result is too large to inline, it is parked on disk and the
 * model gets a path. The only way back in is normally a line range, so finding
 * one stack trace in a 60 KB build log means guessing offsets: probe, miss,
 * probe again, each probe costing a turn.
 *
 * Parked results are written once (`flag: 'wx'`) and never rewritten, so a
 * query against one is deterministic for as long as the file exists — the same
 * file and query always render the same bytes into the prompt. That is what
 * makes this safe to run on a replayed message: it cannot shift a prefix that
 * is already cached.
 *
 * Literal, case-insensitive substring only, deliberately not a regex. A
 * model-supplied pattern would be a backtracking hazard on exactly the
 * payloads this exists to search (a minified JSON body parked as one 60 KB
 * line), and it would need escaping rules the model gets wrong. Anything more
 * complex still has the line-range read as an escape hatch.
 *
 * Leaf module (fs + readline only).
