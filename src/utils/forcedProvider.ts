/**
 * Forced-Provider Context
 *
 * AsyncLocalStorage that pins a specific APIProvider for the duration of an
 * async call tree. Used by the Agent tool so each spawned agent can route
 * through a provider of its own instead of the session-global one.
 *
 * How it threads through the stack:
 *
 *   runWithForcedProvider({ provider: 'nvidia' }, () => runAgent(...))
 *       └─ The agent loop calls getAPIProvider() — returns 'nvidia'
 *           └─ Provider routing builds the NVIDIA route
 *
 * Without forcing, getAPIProvider() falls back to its normal session-cached
 * value, so ordinary single-agent code is unchanged.
 *
 * IMPORTANT: AsyncLocalStorage is preserved across awaits and promise chains
 * within the same async context, but does NOT propagate across `setImmediate`
 * scheduled outside the run callback, `worker_threads`, or fresh event-loop
 * tasks. The agent loop runs entirely inside the callback so this is fine.
