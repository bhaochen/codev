/**
 * Top-level on/off lifecycle for /remote, in two modes.
 *
 *   local  — bind the LAN address; the phone must share your Wi-Fi. Free,
 *            instant, nothing leaves the network.
 *   global — same server behind a free Cloudflare quick tunnel, reachable
 *            from cellular and on a real HTTPS origin.
 *
 * Deliberately not persisted across restarts: a listener that revives itself
 * without being asked is a surprise, and the token would be stale anyway.
 *
 * Starting or stopping never touches the agent loop, the message array, or the
 * prompt cache — the server is a side channel onto state the REPL already
 * holds, so /remote can be turned on mid-turn without disturbing the run.
