/**
 * Decides what a phone on the same Wi-Fi can dial to reach this session.

 * lan.ts reads this machine's adapters; this module decides whether any of
 * them is reachable at all, which depends on where Codev runs:
 *
 *   Windows, macOS, Linux, WSL 1  the adapters are the machine's own.
 *   WSL 2, mirrored networking    the distro shares Windows' adapters.
 *   WSL 2, NAT (the default)      the distro only sees its own eth0 on a
 *                                 private virtual switch inside Windows.
 *
 * The last case is why a phone got "connection timed out": the QR carried the
 * eth0 address, which exists only inside the PC. Nothing on the Linux side
 * can fix that — Windows would need a port forward, which takes admin rights
 * — so local mode says so instead of printing a code that can never work.
 *
 * CODEV_REMOTE_HOST overrides everything, for setups detection cannot see: a
 * port forwarded from Windows, a published container port, a reverse proxy.
