/**
 * Out-of-band placement of terminal graphics (sixel / Kitty / iTerm2) inside an
 * Ink frame.
 *
 * Graphics protocols cannot live in the cell buffer: `Output.write()` tokenizes
 * SGR into interned styles and writes grapheme clusters, so a DCS or APC
 * payload would be shredded. They are therefore written *after* the frame's
 * text patches, with the cursor moved to the image's origin and put back
 * afterwards, so the pixels land on top of the cells the layout reserved.
 *
 * The hard part is not drawing but erasing. Pixels are invisible to Ink's cell
 * model: the frame diff rewrites a cell only when its *text* changes, so when a
 * graphic moves — the transcript scrolls, the window resizes — the cells it
 * used to cover often compare equal and are skipped, and the old pixels stay on
 * screen under the new ones. That is the duplicated, overlapping image.
 *
 * Two erases are used, in that order. Kitty can be told to drop an image by id
 * (`a=d`), which needs no cursor position and no theory about where the pixels
 * ended up — it reaches even a payload that overflowed its box or a rectangle
 * clipped away at the viewport edge. Sixel and iTerm2 have nothing equivalent,
 * so a placement also remembers the rectangle it last drew into and repaints
 * those cells from the *current* frame. Repainting rather than blanking is what
 * makes that safe: whatever text has since moved in is restored exactly, and
 * the stale pixels are overwritten as a side effect of writing characters.
 *
 * A placement is skipped — falling back to the cells beneath, after erasing —
 * when the node did not render, when its box is not wholly inside the viewport
 * (the cursor cannot address a row that has scrolled away), when the cell
 * geometry it was encoded against no longer holds, or while a resize has left
 * that geometry unmeasured. The last of those is the zoom case: a payload is a
 * fixed number of pixels, so once the cell size changes it no longer matches
 * the box the layout reserves, and when the new cell is smaller it spills past
 * the rectangle the erase is computed from, where nothing can ever clear it.
 *
 * One exception to the viewport rule: an image already drawn that leaves
 * through the top, unmoved and unchanged, is not erased. The terminal carried
 * its pixels into history along with the text, and taking them down there is
 * permanent — nothing can draw above the viewport again.
 *
 * Which is why, on the main screen, this post-frame pass is not the only
 * drawer. Rows go out one after another and scroll as they do, so a box can be
 * pushed past the top by the very frame that created it — images arriving
 * together, a reply streaming in behind one, a full reset reprinting the whole
 * transcript. The frame writer therefore draws each image as it writes the
 * box's last row, while its top is still on screen ({@link planRowGraphics}),
 * and a box that ends up in history undrawn anyway asks for the rows to be
 * written again ({@link takeGraphicsReprintRequest}).

   * the content does.
   *
   * Overflowing the **top** is the main-screen shape, and it is the one that

   * can never run past it; an image too tall for the window loses its own
   * *top*. Nothing below the image moves when it shrinks, so removing one row
   * lifts the transcript end by one and drops the box's top by one relative to
   * the viewport — shrinking to exactly the rows still visible lands the top on
   * `viewportTop`, exactly. Declining to report that was the whole of "it goes
   * blocky when the window gets shorter and never comes back": the row budget
   * leaves a fixed ten rows for chrome, which stops being enough below a 40-row
   * viewport, and the only recovery path was one that cannot fire here.
   *
   * Budgeted per epoch so this answers a *window* change, not a scroll. A
   * streaming transcript pushes an image off the top too, and shrinking there
   * would fight the scroll a step at a time until it hit the floor and fell
   * back to blocks anyway. An image genuinely scrolled into history yields a
   * number below `MIN_PLACEMENT_ROWS`, which `reportRowLimit` declines, so the
   * two cases separate themselves.
   *
   * With `scrollback` set this is not used any more: the frame writer draws a
   * box as its rows go out, so a box shorter than the window never needs to
   * shrink to be drawn. Shrinking it there moved every row below it, forcing a
   * full reset, and left the image smaller than the window allows.
