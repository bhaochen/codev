 * are noise until they are not. So the collapsed transcript shows one line and
 * Ctrl+O shows everything.
 *
 * The block is EXCISED rather than truncated from. A failed cell's text is
 * stdout, then the traceback, then the `[tool bridge]` summary, so cutting to
 * the end would swallow the bridge section too. Whatever the cell printed
 * before it died is kept — that output is usually why the failure makes sense.
 *
 * Returns null when there is no traceback to collapse, which leaves the result
 * rendered verbatim rather than guessing at its shape.
 *
 * Display only: the model's copy of the result still carries the whole
 * traceback. It is the one that has to debug the cell.
